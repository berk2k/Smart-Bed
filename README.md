# Smart-Bed 

# Problem​ 
-Patients spend 49-98% of their time in their bed. ​</br>
-Lack of mobility -> long list of health issues​​</br>
-Pressure ulcers  -> 54.8% chance of developing pressure ulcers after undergoing surgery.​</br>
# Product Idea 
-Create a smart bed with pressure sensors ​</br>
-Monitor patient movement ​</br>
-Alert nurse of patient activity​</br>
-Save and analyze data</br>

# Future Prospects
Idea: Provide a QR code or URL where a patient's information is accessible on a browser.​<br/>
Implementation: HTML file that uses values from database to generate a graph​<br/>
Purpose: Nurse have a visual of patient behavior​<br/>
Results: Create patterns and draw conclusions<br/>
